#  GitHub Profile Page UI – Cloning Project

##  Overview
This project is a recreated version of the GitHub profile page UI.  
I built it using **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS** as part of my internship journey at Cyberdude Networks Private Limited.  
The main goal was to understand real-world UI structuring, spacing, responsiveness, and layout clarity.
